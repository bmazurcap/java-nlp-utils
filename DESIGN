Differences from Klein NLP framework
- util/
  - Counter(Map)
    - Moved to double[]([])*
    - Encoded by default (access methods for templated values, raw integers)
    - Expose raw double[]([])* for fast access
    - Encoding for same types should share int values (counter1.encode("raw") == counter2.encode("raw"))
      (e.g. a.equals(b) <=> encode(a) == encode(b) -> use the interner)
    - Works for log distributions as well as non-log
- math/
  - CounterMath
    - Operates on raw backing for counters
    - Requires same templated type - for KL divergence etc.
    - Smoothing / Normalization
  - DifferentiableFunction
    - Built in caching
