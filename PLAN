- Start with math & util
  + Counter types
  + Switch for log / normal counter  
  + SharedIndex for Counters (encoding / interner)
  + Raw access
  - CounterMap
    - Sparse and Dense (default is Dense)
    - Sparse needs to switch to HashMap<Int,Int> for reverse index
      - Is there any reason to use array? - Use case is better with Dense, or can be handled by Dense directly
  - DoubleArrays code
    - Also IntegerArrays, Double2DArrays, ...
  - CounterMath (extends DoubleArrays)
  - Documentation
- Some basic models
  - Naive bayes	(word classification)
  - HMM (Tagging)
